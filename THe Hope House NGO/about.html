            <p class="one" style="text-align: justify;" >
                Cancer treatment in our country is highly priced and majority of elders are not covered by any form of medical insurance.
                Therefore the biggest challenge has been to provide sustained healthcare intervention for needy elderly cancer patients.
                The Hope House NGO provides palliative care to cancer patients in partnership with a number of credible and competent
                cancer hospitals and organizations. These partners also conduct cancer awareness and cancer detection camps. Thus, from
                cancer detection and treatment, our partners have been able to deliver quality cancer care for elders in need of such
                intervention, including home visits post cancer treatment along with counselling for the patient and family. 
                Over 99,000 treatments have been supported since 1998.
